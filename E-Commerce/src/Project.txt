Sure, I can provide you with an outline for your shopping app project. Keep in mind that the details may vary based on your preferences and the specific functionalities you want to implement. Here's a rough description:

1. **Project Structure:**
   - **src/components:**
     - **HomePage:** Contains the slider for product images and displays types of products.
     - **ProductTypesPage:** Displays different types of products. Clicking on a type should navigate to the products page for that type.
     - **ProductPage:** Displays individual products. Clicking on a product should navigate to the full product page.
     - **FullProductPage:** Displays detailed information about a product and provides an option to add it to the cart.
     - **ContactPage:** A simple page with a contact form.

   - **src/pages:**
     - **Home.jsx:** Renders the HomePage component.
     - **ProductTypes.jsx:** Renders the ProductTypesPage component.
     - **Products.jsx:** Renders the ProductPage component.
     - **FullProduct.jsx:** Renders the FullProductPage component.
     - **Contact.jsx:** Renders the ContactPage component.

   - **src/context:**
     - **AuthProvider:** Manages user authentication state.

   - **src/hooks:**
     - Custom hooks if needed for managing specific functionalities.

   - **src/utils:**
     - Utility functions, constants, or configurations.

   - **src/assets:**
     - Images, styles, and other assets.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - `react-router-dom` for handling navigation.
   - `axios` or `fetch` for API calls to fetch product data.
   - A UI library (like Material-UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind CSS) for styling.
   - `framer-motion` or `react-spring` for animation.
   - `react-snipcart` for integrating Snipcart into your React app.
   - `react-hook-form` for managing forms (used in the contact page).

3. **Integration with Snipcart:**
   - Snipcart simplifies the shopping cart and checkout process. You'll need to integrate the Snipcart script into your application. Follow Snipcart's documentation for the specific steps.

4. **AI for UI Design:**
   - You can use tools like Framer, Adobe XD, or Figma to create initial designs. While they don't use AI to generate designs, they provide a powerful interface for designing user interfaces.

5. **Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication using Firebase, Auth0, or any other authentication provider. Manage the authentication state using the AuthProvider.

6. **Additional Tips:**
   - Ensure good UX/UI design practices.
   - Consider responsiveness for various devices.
   - Optimize performance, especially when dealing with images.
   - Add testing for critical functionalities.

Remember to check the documentation of each library or service you plan to use for detailed implementation instructions.


Make on the home page type component to route to the type of the `/products/${product.type}/${product.id}`
